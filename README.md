## Thank you for this opportunity!

This is a demo laravel app implementing limited features in accordance with the questionnaire requirements.

### Steps to Setup

 * As you have extracted the zip archive into your `www` or `public-html` directory, open the `.env` file and update the `APP_URL` variable accordingly
 * Create a MySQL user and a database. Do not forget to assign appropriate privileges to the new user.
 * Update the values of the `DB_HOST`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` variables with your new database credentials.
 * Ensure you set the correct owner/permissions values for the app directory and the storage subdirectory
 * Run `php artisan migrate` to create the required database tables
